# LOR 
A site to help individuals and employers connect through mutual endorsements.
I have had this growing urge to reach out to past employers, or peers whom I've worked with (and had positive experiences working with or for)
however, there are a few issues with asking for a **letter of recommendation**.

**1.) Employer recollection** -
Your former boss probably has enough on their plate to remember specifics of your time working for them. 
Both parties would benefit from a service which enables the employer to write a recommendation letter soon after their employee leaves.  This site could offer a way of recording details of their employee's experience without compromising the integrity/credibility of the letter.
      
**2.) Employee's Timing** - 
I have often felt that timing is really important when asking for a letter of recomendation. By allowing open submissions, 
employers can take as much or as little time on a former employee's letter. 
It doesn't make sense to have to rush a recommendation, so this platform could offer a solution.

**3.) Future Employment**
When you are being interviewed for a new job it is much easier to give a link which allows employers to explore recomendations at their leisure.
